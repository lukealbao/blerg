I admit to being annoyed by the phrase. It's usually said with the
same tone as "God works in mysterious ways," where it serves as a closing
remark, a sentence that precludes any further thought into the
matter. *No point thinking about it any more,* it says, *just embrace
fate and be at peace*. And it's just always rubbed me the wrong way. I
can appreciate the desire for tranquility, and I value the ability to know
when something is out of your control, but it just struck me as lazy
and safe.

Lately, though, I've come to value the idea, not in its use as a conversation
stopper, but as a jumping-off point to *begin* thinking. It's a
way to remind myself that *it*, whatever it is, *is*, regardless of
what I think
about it, and, more importantly, how I feel about it. It's all too
easy to conflate reality with my conception of reality. Who knows how
many arguments I've been in because I perceived a threat where one
didn't exist? How often is it that I attribute my mood (good or bad) to one thing,
when in fact that mood began well before? I'll bet that if we could read the hidden history of the
world, we would find entire wars that could have been avoided if only
a single man's shoes weren't too tight. Or something like that.

Reminding yourself that it is what it is doesn't have to remove you
from the world into a space of safe fatalism. But it ought to remove
you from the *center* of the world. The idea can be humbling. It is also freeing. It's hard to feel curious
about a world in which everything is either a threat or a reward. But
if *it is what it is*, prior to your feelings about it, you're free to
have a tender, productive curiosity about it. The
religions say you have to become like a child to enter the kingdom of
heaven. Show me a child that is free to pursue her curiosity, and I'll
show you heaven.
