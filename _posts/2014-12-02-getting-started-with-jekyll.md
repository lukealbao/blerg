and even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.

cosily up, and the tea-things stood ready to the sitter's elbow, the
very sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay
beside the tea-things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy
of a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great
esteem, annotated, in his own hand, with startling blasphemies.

So begins the disjointed and halting career of this blog. It's created
with the [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) static site generator and
hosted on Amazon's [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) delivery
network. It was pretty simple to set up, but I'm looking for a way to
push the site directly with [git](http://www.git-scm.com/).

For now, you should stop reading - in part because these first posts
are never interesting, and in part because this one has reached its motherfucking
end.
