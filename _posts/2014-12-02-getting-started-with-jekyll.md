This site is created with [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com). Unlike,
say, WordPress, Jekyll requires no database or programming language to
live on the server, so it's fast and cheap to host. As a static site
generator, Jekyll takes a bunch of component files and processes them into
an entire site.

Since doing this with any sort of customization requires one to work
with a bunch of text files and (admittedly, very intuitive) languages
and frameworks, using Jekyll as a platform has become a strong social
signifier. It says: "I'm a geek. Except, you know, like, a cool one."

<aside>Forget the fact that real geeks don't want to be seen as
geeks.</aside>

So, fair warning, then. This whole thing exists mainly for that
purpose. I'd like to think that it will be populated by writings that
can be of interest to others. I guess we'll see. For now, you should
stop reading - in part because these first posts are never
interesting, and in part because this one has reached its end.
